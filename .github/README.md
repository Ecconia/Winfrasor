# Winfrasor - A Tab framework

## What is this Java-Swing framework good for?

With it, you are able to create one component which may receive Tabs via drag and drop.
It is possible to drop a Tab in 4 areas of all components to place it besides such a component, this results in a split view. Tab panes provide Tabs via dragging.

## Features

* TabPane which has content area and Tab bar at the top.
* Reordering Tabs in the Tab bar by drag&drop.
* Creating split views, by dropping a Tab on one of the 4 half sides of a drop-area (any component).
* Drop position highlighting.
* Support for custom Elements.

### TODO's

* Proper API (WIP, coming soon).
* Custom styling (Currently there is only one style, later on it should be possible using custom UI classes).
* Drag&Drop preview (A little snapshot of the Tab which are getting dragged. Visible down-right under the cursor).

## How to use it?

* Copy the Java files into your project.
* Create a Winfrasor object and call the generators on it. Start by creating a root pane and adding that to your window.
* Create Splitter and TabPanes and add them to the RootPane.
* Add custom Elements or Tabs to your structure.
